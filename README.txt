Scans WordPress plugin, theme, and core directories for malicious code injections.

== Description ==
 This plugin was born because my own WordPress site got hacked, and I needed a quick way to track down which files have had code injected into them.
 It will scan for the key words I found to be common in WordPress code injection situations.

== Installation ==
  Upload Code Scanner to your WordPress blog and activate it.
  That's it!
